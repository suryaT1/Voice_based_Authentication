        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>The model uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for speaker identification and gender prediction. It has been trained on a large dataset of voice samples and utilizes popular Python libraries such as <strong>Librosa</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and <strong>Scikit-learn</strong> for preprocessing and prediction tasks.</p>
